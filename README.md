# 🧬 Pneumonia Classification 🧬

This project features an AI model for diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Users can upload a chest X-ray image through the app, and the model will classify it.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI Model**: A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model trained using Keras.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Visual Feedback**: Classification results are displayed immediately below the uploaded image.
- **Background Image**: The application uses a custom background image.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/pneumonia-classification.git
    ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
